🔐 Random Password Generator

Welcome to the Random Password Generator! This simple Python script allows you to generate a strong, random password consisting of:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Lowercase letters (a-z)

Digits (0-9)

Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, !, etc.)

💡 Features

User-defined password length

Uses Python's random and string modules

Generates secure and unpredictable passwords

Lightweight and easy to use

🛠️ How It Works

Prompts the user to input the desired password length.

Combines all possible characters (letters, digits, punctuation) into a single pool.

Randomly selects characters from this pool until the password reaches the desired length.

Prints the final password for the user to copy and use.

🧪 Example
bash

------------------WELCOME TO RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR--------------------------


-> THE PASSWORD THAT WILL BE GENERATED WILL CONTAIN RANDOM COMBINATION OF (A-Z),(a-z),(0-9), AND SPECIAL CHARECTERS.


-> WHAT SHOULD BE THE LENGTH OF PASSWORD :- 12


BINGO! YOUR RANDOM PASSWORD HAS SUCCESSFULLY GENERATED :- $tV7z@P1^Fq!

📦 Requirements

Python 3.x

No additional packages needed — this script uses Python's built-in modules:

python

import random
import string

🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

Save the script in a file, for example: password_generator.py

Run it from the terminal:

bash

📝 Notes

The generated password is printed directly to the console. Make sure to copy it before closing the terminal.

For enhanced security, never reuse generated passwords or share them with others.
